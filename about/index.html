      <h3>Testimonials</h3>

      <blockquote>"When working with Chris, he was good at sensing my mood, whether it was 'alright let's hit it' or 'I really don't want to do this today'.  He never let me slack off but neither did he push me so hard that I did not want to come back for the next appointment."

      <blockquote>"From my experience, Chris knows how to set up a routine to fit the individual.  He does not use the one size fits all approach."</blockquote>

      <blockquote>"Chris is a personable guy who provides great one-on-one training.  He watches your form to make sure you are getting the most from your exercises and keeps the encouragement going throughout the workout, to make sure you finish your reps!"</blockquote>

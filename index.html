        <h2>Simple Sustainable Fitness</h2>
        <p>
          Fitness matters, but why is it so tough to keep a program going? Sometimes it just doesn't stick. I think a lot of our fitness gets derailed when we complicate things and force ourselves into attaining goals that contradict our lifestyles.<br><br> When I work with my clients, I strive to understand their needs, professional responsibilities and personal commitments. Taking the whole person into account means I can craft better fitness plans that work <i>with</i> and not <i>against</i> a person's everyday life. All of this happens at home, making my coaching not just convenient but also effective longterm. Let's simplify your fitness!

        <h2>Professional Coaching</h2>
        <p>I have been coaching people with various fitness goals for over 20 years. It has been work I thoroughly enjoy and cannot ever see myself ending. Experience has helped me a lot to understand my clients and how best to build them an in-home program that gets them to where they want. But obviously experience is only good with quality professional training.</p>

        <h2>Home Is Where The Fitness Is</h2>
        <p>Quality fitness doesn't have to come from a gym. It doesn't require expensive equipment either. No, quality fitness is determined by simple, precise movements and consistent application. I work with all my clients from their homes. <br><br> Why? The real work begins when I leave. People are more likely to maintain their fitness with a trainer beside them, coaching them through the exercises. That's what I love to do, but it's also important for my clients to do some solo homework. Having a plan that fits the person and the person's space/equipment restrictions means a greater likelihoood he or she will keep up the work - and look forward to doing the work in the first place.</p>

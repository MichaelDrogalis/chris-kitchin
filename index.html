      <h3>Convenient Personal Training</h3>
      <p>One of the best reasons to hire an in-home personal trainer is <i>convenience</i>. I come to you - on your schedule. I bring all needed equipment for a personalized, functional and effective workout.

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>The best reason to work with me is my extensive background in personal training,including 20 years experience working with all types of individuals with the full range of goals.  I love what I do and what I do is teach my clients why they are doing certain exercises, how their breathing will help them through a movement, how to hold a specific posture, and what they should feel when they are doing the exercise on their own.</p>

      <p>Many of my clients already exercise regularly.  But they may not push themselves through the last two or three repetition.
I can help them to move beyond what they think are their limits.  I do this during my one hour, private personal training sessions.  You can schedule a few sessions to begin the process or schedule the normal 10 week package.</p>

      <p>Please contact me for pricing and availability at 206-390-0052 or <a href="mailto:kitch_kitchin@yahoo.com">kitch_kitchin@yahoo.com</a>.</p>
